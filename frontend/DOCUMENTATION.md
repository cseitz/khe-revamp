# Documentation for KHE Frontend

This document outlines all that this project consists of.

If you need function references for specific parameters, logic, usage, and return data then check out [This](./JSDOC.md)!

## Important Warning
Anything with a comment label of **"CORE COMPONENT"** should not be changed in any way other than styling. Feel free to add extra HTML tags as necessary to stylize it how you desire, but avoid messing with the structure and the named core components. If you stick to this, it should be easy to turn a barebones signup form into whatever look you desire!
